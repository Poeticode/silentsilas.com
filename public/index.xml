      <description>You knew that they were joking,But over time, the lies took root.It&#39;s a belief you couldn&#39;t shakeWithout their &#34;fate&#34; becoming Truth.You are as they say,And they&#39;ve said quite a lot.The more you fight against it,The more that must be fought. </description>

      <description>To your disbelief,This moment passed.You chased it down,But it runs too fast.It&#39;s one step aheadIn the wrong directionUntil you&#39;re lostIn imperfection.==To your relief,This moment passed.But you couldn&#39;t runFrom its aftermath.You sought out shelterBut had to keep movingAfter planting the flowersYou&#39;d never see blooming. </description>

      <description>The perma-pedestrian Watched in awe Of the passing cars.Each driver longsTo extend their lifeWith Audis &amp; Jaguars.Each piston obeysThermodynamic lawExploding every decisecond.The law of inertiaTransfers heat to our headsUpon braking at the intersection.The human VROOMS.Huffs and FUMES.Shortcircuits- KaBOOMS!The cycle repeatsUntil there remainsNo more lives to lose. </description>

      <description>The neighbors watchedOur grass growAs they gossiped aboutUs riffraff.We tried our bestTo lay low,But still felt the scornIn each laugh.Even our ownBrought a sense of shameWith no one to blameOn our behalf.ParsimonyParts the lonelyUntil one hasThe last half. </description>

      <description>The information above is just a small snippet of your browser&amp;rsquo;s fingerprint. It&amp;rsquo;s the data that websites can collect about the device you&amp;rsquo;re using. (They&amp;rsquo;re also able to access your GPS if you&amp;rsquo;re silly enough to let them.)
At first glance, the data looks pretty innocuous. Who cares if people know what browser you&amp;rsquo;re using, or what plugins you&amp;rsquo;ve installed? Is it the end of the world if they know that you&amp;rsquo;re a Mac user?</description>

      <description>Hey there! Welcome to Silent Silas. I write code during the day, and poetry at night. This is my playground.
This section in particular is where I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss my terrible opinions on life, the universe, and the objectification of humanity.
For the web developers out there, this is a static site built with Hugo, styled with Tachyons, sped up with Turbolinks, and animated with both ThreeJS and GreenSock. It&amp;rsquo;ll eventually use Service Workers so that the entirety of the site is available offline.</description>

      <description>You can call it unfair.Is that your final decision?Inaction is still an actOft&#39; deserving derision.You can say it&#39;s no use.Is that all you can teach?The complacent are usefulTo their ongoing siege. </description>

      <description>You placed my kingIn a surprising checkTo ensure Iâ€™m keptOn the tip of my toes.Only a fewOf our pieces are left,And each one of my movesAre presupposed.Unbeknownst,Synonymous to beginner.A satisfying poachAwarded to the winner. </description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen tears fall
From the face of a giant,
A hint of desperation
In the pleas of a king,
An attempt to forgive
The guilt-tripping violent,
Their genuine surprise
That neither learned a thing.
The wishes of a mother
Remain whispers in the wind,
And the riches of the world
In the words of humbled men.</description>

      <description>Here are two tracks I made in FamiTracker that I&amp;rsquo;m actually a bit proud of! They were probably written back in 2011.
 You can check out the raw .ftm file here, which you would open in Famitracker to see all of the notes laid out.
 Same as above, you can check out the .ftm file here.</description>

      <description>I stopped myselfTo take a breather,But I took it far too late.My reluctant lungsCould hardly handleThe second-hand sadnessYours create.Each blessing that fallsInto your handSoon meets its matchAnd asphyxiates. </description>

      <description>I thought my heart was broken,Or its voice far too soft-spokenUntil I walked past by a grave.It was normally unkempt and bare,But today a rose sings it a prayer:A somber song their lover gave. </description>

      <description>Our skin&#39;s as thickAs our words are sharpTo dampen the damageWe take to heart.But sometimes they pierceRight through our defenses,Despite whether the offender Had the best of intentions.It&#39;s a wound that lingersAnd leads to a scarOnce committed to memory(Which shapes who you are).For each one we&#39;ve endured,We&#39;ve dealt so many moreFor the most innocuous remarkStill can pierce like a sword.</description>

      <description>Do you happen to haveA cigarette I could bum?Just to hold in my handTo help reminisce someTo bring me back to a timeWhen I had it all togetherAnd the worst of my worriesWas exploring Minecraft&#39;s Nether.In fact, could I pleaseBorrow your lighter as well?I won&#39;t actually smoke it;I promise to not inhale.Just the act of smokingPuts my mind at easeAnd places it in Bear CreekEnjoying the summer&#39;s breeze.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s no reason for us to talkAs we discuss meteorological matters.Our communal cup never fills upFor each time we lose touch, it shatters.You see in me a man from before.I see in you but a shallow shoreWith a receding tideOf our friendship folklore.Is there nothing more?I&#39;ve tired of this one-sided conversationSo I&#39;ll retire and keep myself complacentWith an assuming posture And twiddling of thumbsWith the occasional interjection Of terribly clever puns.</description>

      <description>A few minutes into my morning commute I had forgotten we can all read minds.So my thought faucet ran up my brain bill Spewing a membraneous mess inside.I didnâ€™t notice â€˜til I parked the carAnd smelled the fumes from under the hood. I frantically thought of cats and cookiesTo clean up the mess, but it did no good.So I ditched the car and snuck into work,Though I knew my hopes and dreams would be seen Swirled amidst my self-doubt and worriesLike creamer mixed in bitter cups of caffeine.</description>

      <description>A woman bowed downBefore her plate of spaghettiTo send God a prayerHe&#39;s heard a thousand times already.But Jesus was in suchA mischievous moodThat He let the woman hearWhat the Father thought of her food.&#34;There she goes againWith her cookie-cutter requestFull of empty words meantTo ensure her noodles are blessed.&#34;But the woman quickly answered,&#34;There&#39;s no need to be so rude!</description>

Their last battle cry before the frost.
The further north, the more pronounced
As they recall the life they lost.
Shouting in color upon deaf ears,
Such beauty produced at a deadly cost.
The reds rage on
With blistering hate.
&amp;ldquo;Is there no escape
From our inevitable fate?&amp;rdquo;
The orange reminisce
On the seasons before.
&amp;ldquo;Winter is knocking,
But Spring is next door.</description>

Across the canvas of your brain
To gradually form a masterpiece
With every splatter you gain.
But these splats are not simply skills and facts,
Else you&amp;rsquo;re left with but reds and blues.
For hidden within every facet of life,
Will you find colors of every shade and hue.
But an expansive canvas is required
If you&amp;rsquo;re to create a work of art.
For only to those with a humble mind</description>

      <description>My home houses countless couches.
Klepto-couches with pickpocket pouches
That swiftly swipe your cellular phone
Between the cushions of their comfy unknown.
Then your change jingles and jangles
Until they&amp;rsquo;re untangled
From your Wrangler jeans pocket
As you wonder where your socks went.
But your socks and shoes
Were swept under your feet
Right under your nose.
So discreet are these deceitful seats
As they watch you search
For the keys they stole.</description>

      <description>Silence speaks louder than words
At a decibel too loud to be heard
As an abrupt disruption of nothin&amp;rsquo;
For our conversation consumption.
Its presence is chilling
And instant buzz-killing
Yet still we act
As if it&amp;rsquo;s not there.
Our tongues are untied
As the silence subsides
Yet still its message
Hangs heavy in the air.</description>

      <description>Oh, my good friend, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to leave.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, so no longer grieve!
If I could, I would run back to your side.
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen
Your serious face and Chartwell&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.
Often I think this is for the better
\&amp;lsquo;Til I shed tears as I read your letter.
Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.</description>

      <description>Our past predicts how prone we are
To repeat our mistakes in the present.
New Year resolutions are made
To prove ourselves convalescent.
Never again shall we regress
Back to our frail and Fallen state.
Instead, transform into super humans
Gaining skills and losing weight.
Only then will we be pleased
With who we see in the mirror.
On the contrary, oft&amp;rsquo; we find
What harms us, we hold dearer.</description>

      <description>Hours of raking and blowing of leaves
Only to have twice more fall from the trees
By the friendly frolic of an Autumn breeze.
Yet there in the distance an object appears
By the result of your blood, sweat, and tears;
It&amp;rsquo;s the manifestation of your misplaced fears!
As you creep ever closer to the object in sight,
It&amp;rsquo;s not long before you&amp;rsquo;re filled with delight
As your landlocked body begins to take flight</description>

Searching far and wide,
But the grass will still seem greener
On the other side.
I could be surrounded by people who love me
Yet still feel I don&amp;rsquo;t belong.
I could think I&amp;rsquo;m a terrible person
Despite how often told I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
I could accomplish several amazing feats
Yet still believe I&amp;rsquo;m inadequate.
I could try my best to be nice
Yet still remain the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Advocate.</description>

Ever since you left me without warning.

Now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I did you wrong.

That was simply a slip of the tongue.
Is it too late for me to play along?
I fear I&amp;rsquo;m no longer as mysterious,
As wise, and as fearless
As I&amp;rsquo;ve implied myself to be.
I&amp;rsquo;ve revealed my true colors.
I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be discovered;
This shall show my sheer stupidity!

      <description>Please present yourself to the class
By sharing none of your secret past
Tell us your residence, your aspirations,
Your chosen major&amp;rsquo;s concentration,
And maybe some more background knowledge
As to why you&amp;rsquo;re attending this specific college.
But anything more is unnecessary
I mean, who cares your birthday&amp;rsquo;s in February?
We learn not by the things you say
But by the image you portray
From the way you walk, talk, and stare</description>

      <description>These plants look beautiful, but not at this location.
They must be eradicated according to administration.
I brought out my tools; Some gloves and a spade,
Then sat down, Indian style, to begin the raid.
The roots, like little fingers, held on to dear life
As I cut through their homes with an oddly-shaped knife.
To justify these cruel killings
I thought of what they&amp;rsquo;ve done:
Suffocated the superior plants</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re the girl sitting on the park bench.
I&amp;rsquo;m the guy with a leaf blower.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta do my job,
So would you kindly please move over?
I&amp;rsquo;m walking right towards you,
So don&amp;rsquo;t say you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice me.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to get off work soon,
So I&amp;rsquo;ll give you until the count of three.
One
Two
&amp;hellip;
Alright, so you&amp;rsquo;ve called my bluff.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really going to do anything.</description>

Now by watching us humans,
The cold wind is too.</description>

      <description>Silent explosions amidst the stars.
Booming voices that created Mars.
Yet Earth only his finger is placed
And filled it with creatures the devil faced.
All of creation has now withered
Thanks to the one who now slithers.
But a complex plan has been made,
And ages later death is slayed.
God is never seen yet is all-seeing
Of all the actions of human beings.
His guiding voice amidst speeding cars</description>

      <description>Safely set inside this song
Are silent sounds we passed along.
Secret though we seek to know
Signs of its new secret show.
Silence hides up in the skies
Far from folks, cars, and lies.
It only lives to watch us die,
For that is when our souls arrive
And silent sounds are synthesized.</description>

      <description>When you wake up,
Be sure to lay still
Lest your dreams spill
Out like a cup
From a drink offering.</description>
