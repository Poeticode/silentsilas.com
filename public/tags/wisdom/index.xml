      <description>You knew that they were joking,But over time, the lies took root.It&#39;s a belief you couldn&#39;t shakeWithout their Fate becoming Truth.You are what they say,And they&#39;ve said quite a lot.The more you fight against it,The more that must be fought. </description>

      <description>To your disbelief,This moment passed.You chased it down,But it runs too fast.It&#39;s one step aheadIn the wrong directionUntil you&#39;re lostIn imperfection.==To your relief,This moment passed.But you couldn&#39;t runFrom its aftermath.You sought out shelterBut had to keep movingAfter planting the flowersYou&#39;d never see blooming. </description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen tears fall
From the face of a giant,
A hint of desperation
In the pleas of a king,
An attempt to forgive
The guilt-tripping violent,
Their genuine surprise
That neither learned a thing.
The wishes of a mother
Remain whispers in the wind,
And the riches of the world
In the words of humbled men.</description>

      <title>Unintentional Internalization</title>

      <description>Our skin&#39;s as thickAs our words are sharpTo dampen the damageWe take to heart.But sometimes they pierceRight through our defenses,Despite whether the offender Had the best of intentions.It&#39;s a wound that lingersAnd leads to a scarOnce committed to memory(Which shapes who you are).For each one we&#39;ve endured,We&#39;ve dealt so many moreFor the most innocuous remarkStill can pierce like a sword.</description>

      <description>When thingsAre looking good,You tendTo your mirror.But the clarityYou seek,You&#39;ll findTo be inferior. </description>

      <description>Countless information&#39;s unaccounted forThe second the moment has passed.The details you do retain are blurredAnd the retention itself won&#39;t last.The data chosen to be collectedIs picked by your values and beliefs.Who&#39;s to know If the changed past guaranteesThe desired outcome&#39;s Probability to increase?(And what of The endless repercussions it&#39;s released?)In essence, To put it bluntly,Hindsight Is not 20/20.</description>
