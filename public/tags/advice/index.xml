      <description>The perma-pedestrian Watched in awe Of the passing cars.Each driver longsTo extend their lifeWith Audis &amp; Jaguars.Each piston obeysThermodynamic lawExploding every decisecond.The law of inertiaTransfers heat to our headsUpon braking at the intersection.The human VROOMS.Huffs and FUMES.Shortcircuits- KaBOOMS!The cycle repeatsUntil there remainsNo more lives to lose. </description>

      <description>You can call it unfair.Is that your final decision?Inaction is still an actOft&#39; deserving derision.You can say it&#39;s no use.Is that all you can teach?The complacent are usefulTo their ongoing siege. </description>

      <title>How To Tell A Good Joke</title>

      <description>If you promise not to tell, I have heard a good rumor:Wisdom walks hand in hand with good humor.If you&#39;re sworn to secrecy, then let it be known:Let not a word spoken compel nature to groan.If words of wisdom you believe you can afford,Then lend me your ear: Your tongue is a sword.If your lips are sealed, then read from this scroll:What comes out of your mouth reveals your soul.</description>

      <title>How To Learn</title>

      <description>Knowledge is a splatter of color
Across the canvas of your brain
To gradually form a masterpiece
With every splatter you gain.
But these splats are not simply skills and facts,
Else you&amp;rsquo;re left with but reds and blues.
For hidden within every facet of life,
Will you find colors of every shade and hue.
But an expansive canvas is required
If you&amp;rsquo;re to create a work of art.
For only to those with a humble mind</description>

      <title>Note To Self</title>

      <description>Take a few bets
That can&amp;rsquo;t be won.
Accomplish a task
That can&amp;rsquo;t be done.
Face the fears
That can&amp;rsquo;t be outrun.
Be a guiding light
When we&amp;rsquo;ve lost sight
Of the sun.</description>

      <title>New Year&#39;s Retribution</title>
      <link>https://silentsilas.com/writes/new-year-s-retribution/</link>

      <description>Our past predicts how prone we are
To repeat our mistakes in the present.
New Year resolutions are made
To prove ourselves convalescent.
Never again shall we regress
Back to our frail and Fallen state.
Instead, transform into super humans
Gaining skills and losing weight.
Only then will we be pleased
With who we see in the mirror.
On the contrary, oft&amp;rsquo; we find
What harms us, we hold dearer.</description>

      <description>When you wake up,
Be sure to lay still
Lest your dreams spill
Out like a cup
From a drink offering.</description>
