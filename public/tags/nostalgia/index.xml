      <description>Do you happen to haveA cigarette I could bum?Just to hold in my handTo help reminisce someTo bring me back to a timeWhen I had it all togetherAnd the worst of my worriesWas exploring Minecraft&#39;s Nether.In fact, could I pleaseBorrow your lighter as well?I won&#39;t actually smoke it;I promise to not inhale.Just the act of smokingPuts my mind at easeAnd places it in Bear CreekEnjoying the summer&#39;s breeze.</description>

      <description>After we had passed around our timeLike a handout from a middle school teacherWhich left us as curiously disinterestedAs the typical middle school kid-creature,I had begun to realize we all had funWhile I analyzed the past That I hold beneath my beanie.With the help of Aladdin&#39;s nameless genie,Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,I relived the photos we claimFrame us as fresh as a French Martini.</description>
