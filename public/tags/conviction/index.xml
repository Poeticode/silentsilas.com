      <description>A woman bowed downBefore her plate of spaghettiTo send God a prayerHe&#39;s heard a thousand times already.But Jesus was in suchA mischievous moodThat He let the woman hearWhat the Father thought of her food.&#34;There she goes againWith her cookie-cutter requestFull of empty words meantTo ensure her noodles are blessed.&#34;But the woman quickly answered,&#34;There&#39;s no need to be so rude!</description>

      <description>I can tell by your withering leavesAnd dwindling fruits,Your outstretched branchHas lost touch with its roots.You have overextendedTo give wind its due chase,But the rush that you seekWill destroy you posthaste. </description>

      <description>I&#39;m sick of the secretsI keep tucked away Within my liver and lungsAt the end of each day.Soon my body Will begin to talk back.Songs full of secretsWill spill from the cracks.My apologies.I fearI&#39;m just as hollow as well.I sing doxologies,But I&#39;ll appearTo follow all hellOnce my liver and lungsBegin to talk backOnce they&#39;re sickOf the secretsSpilling from the cracksFor I knewSmoke and water Will take the formOf its vesselBut little did I knowBoth will leakWhen I wrestleMy Sculptor.</description>
