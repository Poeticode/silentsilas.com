      <description>Oh, my good friend, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to leave.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, so no longer grieve!
If I could, I would run back to your side.
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen
Your serious face and Chartwell&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.
Often I think this is for the better
\&amp;lsquo;Til I shed tears as I read your letter.
Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.</description>

      <description>Lost my reason to wake in the morning
Ever since you left me without warning.
We&amp;rsquo;ve always seemed to have gotten along
Now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I did you wrong.
Lost my reason to give you thanks and praise.
Each day that passes passes in a daze.
The life I live is a life of decay.
My happiness happens to never stay.
I would have treated you so much better,</description>
