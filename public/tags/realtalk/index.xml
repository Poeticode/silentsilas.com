      <description>To your disbelief,This moment passed.You chased it down,But it runs too fast.It&#39;s one step aheadIn the wrong directionUntil you&#39;re lostIn imperfection.==To your relief,This moment passed.But you couldn&#39;t runFrom its aftermath.You sought out shelterBut had to keep movingAfter planting the flowersYou&#39;d never see blooming. </description>

      <description>Do you still claim for there to beNo chance of a random possibilityBecause our God planned out eternity?But what good does that do For the likes of me?If you don&#39;t know the hand you&#39;re dealtAnd faithfulness determines not your wealth,Then why not loosen up your bible belt?We can only ascertain Our ascent To heaven or hell.The rain falls down on the wicked and the just.</description>

      <description>Honesty is the best policy
If you&amp;rsquo;re considered prodigy.
But I&amp;rsquo;m left a prodigal son
With money and meals my idolatry.
Spinning webs of lies
To hide the mess inside.
Donning the mask of Jekyll
As I sip the serum of Hyde.</description>

      <title>How To Learn</title>

      <description>Knowledge is a splatter of color
Across the canvas of your brain
To gradually form a masterpiece
With every splatter you gain.
But these splats are not simply skills and facts,
Else you&amp;rsquo;re left with but reds and blues.
For hidden within every facet of life,
Will you find colors of every shade and hue.
But an expansive canvas is required
If you&amp;rsquo;re to create a work of art.
For only to those with a humble mind</description>

      <description>Silence speaks louder than words
At a decibel too loud to be heard
As an abrupt disruption of nothin&amp;rsquo;
For our conversation consumption.
Its presence is chilling
And instant buzz-killing
Yet still we act
As if it&amp;rsquo;s not there.
Our tongues are untied
As the silence subsides
Yet still its message
Hangs heavy in the air.</description>

      <description>Love is a free fallAnd I&#39;m afraid of the ground.If I jump and no one&#39;s there,Will my body make a sound? </description>

      <description>Am I the clothes on my back
And the hair on my head?
Am I the people I&amp;rsquo;m with
And the words I&amp;rsquo;ve said?
Am I the field I study
And the school I attend?
Am I the programs I write
And the poems I&amp;rsquo;ve penned?
Am I the music I enjoy
And the guitar I play?
Am I the grade on my test
And my ten page essay?
Am I the habits I&amp;rsquo;ve formed</description>

      <title>Ill With Want</title>

      <description>I could travel across the land
Searching far and wide,
But the grass will still seem greener
On the other side.
I could be surrounded by people who love me
Yet still feel I don&amp;rsquo;t belong.
I could think I&amp;rsquo;m a terrible person
Despite how often told I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
I could accomplish several amazing feats
Yet still believe I&amp;rsquo;m inadequate.
I could try my best to be nice
Yet still remain the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Advocate.</description>

      <title>Verbal Blunder</title>

      <description>No!
That was simply a slip of the tongue.
Is it too late for me to play along?
I fear I&amp;rsquo;m no longer as mysterious,
As wise, and as fearless
As I&amp;rsquo;ve implied myself to be.
I&amp;rsquo;ve revealed my true colors.
I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be discovered;
This shall show my sheer stupidity!
\&amp;lsquo;Tis time to hang up my hat and accept this mistake
Since it seems I don&amp;rsquo;t quite have what it takes</description>

      <description>Please present yourself to the class
By sharing none of your secret past
Tell us your residence, your aspirations,
Your chosen major&amp;rsquo;s concentration,
And maybe some more background knowledge
As to why you&amp;rsquo;re attending this specific college.
But anything more is unnecessary
I mean, who cares your birthday&amp;rsquo;s in February?
We learn not by the things you say
But by the image you portray
From the way you walk, talk, and stare</description>
