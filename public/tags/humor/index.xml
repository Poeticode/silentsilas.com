      <description>A woman bowed downBefore her plate of spaghettiTo send God a prayerHe&#39;s heard a thousand times already.But Jesus was in suchA mischievous moodThat He let the woman hearWhat the Father thought of her food.&#34;There she goes againWith her cookie-cutter requestFull of empty words meantTo ensure her noodles are blessed.&#34;But the woman quickly answered,&#34;There&#39;s no need to be so rude!</description>

      <description>When I&#39;m hammered,I&#39;m left enamoredAnd content With the FateLady luck&#39;s prescribed.Though we neverWill land together,We&#39;re fledglingsWith new wingsTo take to the sky.I ponder your passionTo pursue aspirationsAnd wonder what magicYou&#39;ll perform upon nationsAnd I speculate the oddsGiven a perfect situationIn a parallel universeIf I&#39;d rise to the occasion. </description>

      <title>Klepto Couches</title>

      <description>My home houses countless couches.
Klepto-couches with pickpocket pouches
That swiftly swipe your cellular phone
Between the cushions of their comfy unknown.
Then your change jingles and jangles
Until they&amp;rsquo;re untangled
From your Wrangler jeans pocket
As you wonder where your socks went.
But your socks and shoes
Were swept under your feet
Right under your nose.
So discreet are these deceitful seats
As they watch you search
For the keys they stole.</description>

      <description>It is all folly!
The grass withers, flowers fade,
But the weeds still grow.</description>

      <title>Breakfast Blue Pt. 2</title>

      <description>Oh, my good friend, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to leave.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, so no longer grieve!
If I could, I would run back to your side.
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen
Your serious face and Chartwell&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.
Often I think this is for the better
\&amp;lsquo;Til I shed tears as I read your letter.
Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.</description>

      <description>I spent three quarters
On a whole cookie
To hear its half-baked
Two cents.</description>

      <description>Hours of raking and blowing of leaves
Only to have twice more fall from the trees
By the friendly frolic of an Autumn breeze.
Yet there in the distance an object appears
By the result of your blood, sweat, and tears;
It&amp;rsquo;s the manifestation of your misplaced fears!
As you creep ever closer to the object in sight,
It&amp;rsquo;s not long before you&amp;rsquo;re filled with delight
As your landlocked body begins to take flight</description>

      <description>I wish I could draw.
Picture&amp;rsquo;s worth a thousand words;
This has just fourteen.</description>

      <description>Lost my reason to wake in the morning
Ever since you left me without warning.
We&amp;rsquo;ve always seemed to have gotten along
Now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I did you wrong.
Lost my reason to give you thanks and praise.
Each day that passes passes in a daze.
The life I live is a life of decay.
My happiness happens to never stay.
I would have treated you so much better,</description>

      <title>Verbal Blunder</title>

      <description>No!
That was simply a slip of the tongue.
Is it too late for me to play along?
I fear I&amp;rsquo;m no longer as mysterious,
As wise, and as fearless
As I&amp;rsquo;ve implied myself to be.
I&amp;rsquo;ve revealed my true colors.
I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be discovered;
This shall show my sheer stupidity!
\&amp;lsquo;Tis time to hang up my hat and accept this mistake
Since it seems I don&amp;rsquo;t quite have what it takes</description>
