      <description>I stopped myselfTo take a breather,But I took it far too late.My reluctant lungsCould hardly handleThe second-hand sadnessYours create.Each blessing that fallsInto your handSoon meets its matchAnd asphyxiates. </description>

      <description>You can&#39;t be let goOnce you&#39;ve clung to the truth.With your treasures in heaven,You&#39;ve got nothing to lose.Now free to live out your lifeWith nothing to proveSave for the love in your heartYou long to share with your crew. </description>

      <description>After we had passed around our timeLike a handout from a middle school teacherWhich left us as curiously disinterestedAs the typical middle school kid-creature,I had begun to realize we all had funWhile I analyzed the past That I hold beneath my beanie.With the help of Aladdin&#39;s nameless genie,Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,I relived the photos we claimFrame us as fresh as a French Martini.</description>
