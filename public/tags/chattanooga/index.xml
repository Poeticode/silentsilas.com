      <description>Do you happen to haveA cigarette I could bum?Just to hold in my handTo help reminisce someTo bring me back to a timeWhen I had it all togetherAnd the worst of my worriesWas exploring Minecraft&#39;s Nether.In fact, could I pleaseBorrow your lighter as well?I won&#39;t actually smoke it;I promise to not inhale.Just the act of smokingPuts my mind at easeAnd places it in Bear CreekEnjoying the summer&#39;s breeze.</description>

      <description>This post-civil-war-torn-townGave refuge To the shackled and bound.This town&#39;s river bubbledWith hope from beneathTo attract the outcastAnd mask the town&#39;s deceit.Traffic soon birthedTo industrial sound.Its booming businessBroke the backs Of the beaten down.Jim Crow rose To further ostracizeAnd whiteout the spotsMissed by redlines.This town&#39;s river bubbledWith sewage from beneath.Today&#39;s gentrified watersTaste just as bittersweet.</description>
