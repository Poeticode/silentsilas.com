      <description>When I&#39;m hammered,I&#39;m left enamoredAnd content With the FateLady luck&#39;s prescribed.Though we neverWill land together,We&#39;re fledglingsWith new wingsTo take to the sky.I ponder your passionTo pursue aspirationsAnd wonder what magicYou&#39;ll perform upon nationsAnd I speculate the oddsGiven a perfect situationIn a parallel universeIf I&#39;d rise to the occasion. </description>

      <description>After we had passed around our timeLike a handout from a middle school teacherWhich left us as curiously disinterestedAs the typical middle school kid-creature,I had begun to realize we all had funWhile I analyzed the past That I hold beneath my beanie.With the help of Aladdin&#39;s nameless genie,Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,I relived the photos we claimFrame us as fresh as a French Martini.</description>

      <description>I sort of spaced out Into an ethereal dreamWhile she fell back Into her usual routineOf noticing Amidst the materialThat Which my eyes have never seen.She ponders for a bit in confusionThe possible reasons for my doubt,But it&#39;s the subject of possibilityThe inexplicable mind can&#39;t figure outAs I soar above the tops of buildingsAnd dive into the Atlantic oceanWith uncanny buoyancy I believedAs just another preconceived notionUntil I cast that factInto the back Of the recycle binAfter I break The REM cycleAnd consciousness clocks back in.</description>

      <description>Oh, my good friend, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to leave.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, so no longer grieve!
If I could, I would run back to your side.
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen
Your serious face and Chartwell&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.
Often I think this is for the better
\&amp;lsquo;Til I shed tears as I read your letter.
Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.</description>
