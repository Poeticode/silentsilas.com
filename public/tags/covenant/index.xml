      <description>After we had passed around our timeLike a handout from a middle school teacherWhich left us as curiously disinterestedAs the typical middle school kid-creature,I had begun to realize we all had funWhile I analyzed the past That I hold beneath my beanie.With the help of Aladdin&#39;s nameless genie,Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,I relived the photos we claimFrame us as fresh as a French Martini.</description>

      <description>It is all folly!
The grass withers, flowers fade,
But the weeds still grow.</description>

      <description>Hours of raking and blowing of leaves
Only to have twice more fall from the trees
By the friendly frolic of an Autumn breeze.
Yet there in the distance an object appears
By the result of your blood, sweat, and tears;
It&amp;rsquo;s the manifestation of your misplaced fears!
As you creep ever closer to the object in sight,
It&amp;rsquo;s not long before you&amp;rsquo;re filled with delight
As your landlocked body begins to take flight</description>

      <description>These plants look beautiful, but not at this location.
They must be eradicated according to administration.
I brought out my tools; Some gloves and a spade,
Then sat down, Indian style, to begin the raid.
The roots, like little fingers, held on to dear life
As I cut through their homes with an oddly-shaped knife.
To justify these cruel killings
I thought of what they&amp;rsquo;ve done:
Suffocated the superior plants</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re the girl sitting on the park bench.
I&amp;rsquo;m the guy with a leaf blower.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta do my job,
So would you kindly please move over?
I&amp;rsquo;m walking right towards you,
So don&amp;rsquo;t say you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice me.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to get off work soon,
So I&amp;rsquo;ll give you until the count of three.
One
Two
&amp;hellip;
Alright, so you&amp;rsquo;ve called my bluff.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really going to do anything.</description>
