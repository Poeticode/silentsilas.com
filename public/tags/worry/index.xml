      <description>A few minutes into my morning commute I had forgotten we can all read minds.So my thought faucet ran up my brain bill Spewing a membraneous mess inside.I didn’t notice ‘til I parked the carAnd smelled the fumes from under the hood. I frantically thought of cats and cookiesTo clean up the mess, but it did no good.So I ditched the car and snuck into work,Though I knew my hopes and dreams would be seen Swirled amidst my self-doubt and worriesLike creamer mixed in bitter cups of caffeine.</description>
