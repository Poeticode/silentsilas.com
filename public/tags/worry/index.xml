      <description>I pine not For grass or trees.This pane of glass Looks fine to me.Ever present Is every presentPresented as the moments pass.Where last is first And first to class.First to thirst For half-full glass.Fully free To see worryAs irrational Impossibility.For the soul you holdCan be sold for gold;You otherwise can&#39;t lose control.Might lose a limb.</description>

      <description>A few minutes into my morning commute I had forgotten we can all read minds.So my thought faucet ran up my brain bill Spewing a membraneous mess inside.I didn’t notice ‘til I parked the carAnd smelled the fumes from under the hood. I frantically thought of cats and cookiesTo clean up the mess, but it did no good.So I ditched the car and snuck into work,Though I knew my hopes and dreams would be seen Swirled amidst my self-doubt and worriesLike creamer mixed in bitter cups of caffeine.</description>
