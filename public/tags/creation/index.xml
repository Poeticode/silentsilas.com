      <description>Silent explosions amidst the stars.
Booming voices that created Mars.
Yet Earth only his finger is placed
And filled it with creatures the devil faced.
All of creation has now withered
Thanks to the one who now slithers.
But a complex plan has been made,
And ages later death is slayed.
God is never seen yet is all-seeing
Of all the actions of human beings.
His guiding voice amidst speeding cars</description>
