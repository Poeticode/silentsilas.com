      <description>You knew that they were joking,But over time, the lies took root.It&#39;s a belief you couldn&#39;t shakeWithout their &#34;fate&#34; becoming Truth.You are as they say,And they&#39;ve said quite a lot.The more you fight against it,The more that must be fought. </description>

      <description>The windows to my soulTend to have their blinds up,And I leave the door locked tightBy keeping my own mouth shutSo my apologies if it&#39;s frustratingThat I&#39;m so cold and calculating.It&#39;s my modus operandi;You can&#39;t spell &#34;Silent&#34; without Si.But if it&#39;s any consolation,I am striving to get betterAt voicing my own thoughtsWithout resorting to writing letters.</description>
