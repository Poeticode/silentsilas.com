      <description>She paints in pixels.Permanent.They can be changed,Or erased, But won&#39;t.That&#39;s not the pointOf presenting points.You present the full picture.Or don&#39;t. </description>

      <description>In a moment Of relapse,A desire For love Arose.I gave my heartstrings To a girlTo knit a warmerSet of clothes.I was hoping For a sweater,But instead, Received her mask.She thanked me kindlyFor the coatAnd I knewI shouldn&#39;t ask.Was itSeasonal depressionThat left me seekingOut a sun?A candleCan&#39;t replace it,But any fireIs better than none.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s no reason for us to talkAs we discuss meteorological matters.Our communal cup never fills upFor each time we lose touch, it shatters.You see in me a man from before.I see in you but a shallow shoreWith a receding tideOf our friendship folklore.Is there nothing more?I&#39;ve tired of this one-sided conversationSo I&#39;ll retire and keep myself complacentWith an assuming posture And twiddling of thumbsWith the occasional interjection Of terribly clever puns.</description>

      <description>I heard the song Held within your heartAnd gave my bestTo play its leading part.But I could neither Determine the key,Nor predictIts syncopated beat. </description>

      <description>You&#39;re the rest of a phraseOn the tip of my tongue.You&#39;re the forgotten hookTo a song I&#39;d once sung.You&#39;re the key to a lockHanging just out of reach.You&#39;re the part of the lessonOur professors couldn&#39;t teach.You&#39;re the tough decisionMy mind could never make.You&#39;re the perfect chordI would find by mistake.You&#39;re the trivial problemsAnd their pseudo-solution.</description>

      <description>When I&#39;m hammered,I&#39;m left enamoredAnd content With the FateLady luck&#39;s prescribed.Though we neverWill land together,We&#39;re fledglingsWith new wingsTo take to the sky.I ponder your passionTo pursue aspirationsAnd wonder what magicYou&#39;ll perform upon nationsAnd I speculate the oddsGiven a perfect situationIn a parallel universeIf I&#39;d rise to the occasion. </description>

      <description>You can&#39;t be let goOnce you&#39;ve clung to the truth.With your treasures in heaven,You&#39;ve got nothing to lose.Now free to live out your lifeWith nothing to proveSave for the love in your heartYou long to share with your crew. </description>

      <description>After we had passed around our timeLike a handout from a middle school teacherWhich left us as curiously disinterestedAs the typical middle school kid-creature,I had begun to realize we all had funWhile I analyzed the past That I hold beneath my beanie.With the help of Aladdin&#39;s nameless genie,Tupac, and the also-immortal Houdini,I relived the photos we claimFrame us as fresh as a French Martini.</description>

      <description>I sort of spaced out Into an ethereal dreamWhile she fell back Into her usual routineOf noticing Amidst the materialThat Which my eyes have never seen.She ponders for a bit in confusionThe possible reasons for my doubt,But it&#39;s the subject of possibilityThe inexplicable mind can&#39;t figure outAs I soar above the tops of buildingsAnd dive into the Atlantic oceanWith uncanny buoyancy I believedAs just another preconceived notionUntil I cast that factInto the back Of the recycle binAfter I break The REM cycleAnd consciousness clocks back in.</description>

      <description>Love is a free fallAnd I&#39;m afraid of the ground.If I jump and no one&#39;s there,Will my body make a sound? </description>

      <description>Oh, my good friend, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to leave.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, so no longer grieve!
If I could, I would run back to your side.
But, alas, a lack of legs slows my stride.
It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen
Your serious face and Chartwell&amp;rsquo;s cuisine.
Often I think this is for the better
\&amp;lsquo;Til I shed tears as I read your letter.
Fake tears, that is, for I also lack eyes.</description>
