      <description>A woman bowed downBefore her plate of spaghettiTo send God a prayerHe&#39;s heard a thousand times already.But Jesus was in suchA mischievous moodThat He let the woman hearWhat the Father thought of her food.&#34;There she goes againWith her cookie-cutter requestFull of empty words meantTo ensure her noodles are blessed.&#34;But the woman quickly answered,&#34;There&#39;s no need to be so rude!</description>

      <description>I can tell by your withering leavesAnd dwindling fruits,Your outstretched branchHas lost touch with its roots.You have overextendedTo give wind its due chase,But the rush that you seekWill destroy you posthaste. </description>

      <description>Do you still claim for there to beNo chance of a random possibilityBecause our God planned out eternity?But what good does that do For the likes of me?If you don&#39;t know the hand you&#39;re dealtAnd faithfulness determines not your wealth,Then why not loosen up your bible belt?We can only ascertain Our ascent To heaven or hell.The rain falls down on the wicked and the just.</description>

      <description>You can&#39;t be let goOnce you&#39;ve clung to the truth.With your treasures in heaven,You&#39;ve got nothing to lose.Now free to live out your lifeWith nothing to proveSave for the love in your heartYou long to share with your crew. </description>

      <description>God and I locked eyes,But it&#39;s hard to look into the face of whom you fear.So instead, I gazed at the throne beneath Him;The ulterior motive for my wicked heart to draw near.God himself broke the stare as well,For it&#39;s hard to look into the face of a disappointing son.So instead, he gazed at Jesus within meWho&#39;s changing my heart &#39;til we hold staring contests for fun.</description>

      <title>Ill With Want</title>

      <description>I could travel across the land
Searching far and wide,
But the grass will still seem greener
On the other side.
I could be surrounded by people who love me
Yet still feel I don&amp;rsquo;t belong.
I could think I&amp;rsquo;m a terrible person
Despite how often told I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
I could accomplish several amazing feats
Yet still believe I&amp;rsquo;m inadequate.
I could try my best to be nice
Yet still remain the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Advocate.</description>

      <description>Silent explosions amidst the stars.
Booming voices that created Mars.
Yet Earth only his finger is placed
And filled it with creatures the devil faced.
All of creation has now withered
Thanks to the one who now slithers.
But a complex plan has been made,
And ages later death is slayed.
God is never seen yet is all-seeing
Of all the actions of human beings.
His guiding voice amidst speeding cars</description>
