      <description>I&#39;m sick of the secretsI keep tucked away Within my liver and lungsAt the end of each day.Soon my body Will begin to talk back.Songs full of secretsWill spill from the cracks.My apologies.I fearI&#39;m just as hollow as well.I sing doxologies,But I&#39;ll appearTo follow all hellOnce my liver and lungsBegin to talk backOnce they&#39;re sickOf the secretsSpilling from the cracksFor I knewSmoke and water Will take the formOf its vesselBut little did I knowBoth will leakWhen I wrestleMy Sculptor.</description>

      <description>Have you a fear of the darkAs I have of the light?I&#39;m afraid of what tomorrowWill reveal of tonight.A new skeleton is forged,Tucked away from your sight.But I&#39;m running out of doorsThat I may keep locked tight. </description>
