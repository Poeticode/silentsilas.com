      <description>I&#39;m sick of the secretsI keep tucked away Within my liver and lungsAt the end of each day.Soon my body Will begin to talk back.Songs full of secretsWill spill from the cracks.My apologies.I fearI&#39;m just as hollow as well.I sing doxologies,But I&#39;ll appearTo follow all hellOnce my liver and lungsBegin to talk backOnce they&#39;re sickOf the secretsSpilling from the cracksFor I knewSmoke and water Will take the formOf its vesselBut little did I knowBoth will leakWhen I wrestleMy Sculptor.</description>

      <description>When I&#39;m hammered,I&#39;m left enamoredAnd content With the FateLady luck&#39;s prescribed.Though we neverWill land together,We&#39;re fledglingsWith new wingsTo take to the sky.I ponder your passionTo pursue aspirationsAnd wonder what magicYou&#39;ll perform upon nationsAnd I speculate the oddsGiven a perfect situationIn a parallel universeIf I&#39;d rise to the occasion. </description>
