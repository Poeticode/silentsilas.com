      <description>I sort of spaced out Into an ethereal dreamWhile she fell back Into her usual routineOf noticing Amidst the materialThat Which my eyes have never seen.She ponders for a bit in confusionThe possible reasons for my doubt,But it&#39;s the subject of possibilityThe inexplicable mind can&#39;t figure outAs I soar above the tops of buildingsAnd dive into the Atlantic oceanWith uncanny buoyancy I believedAs just another preconceived notionUntil I cast that factInto the back Of the recycle binAfter I break The REM cycleAnd consciousness clocks back in.</description>
