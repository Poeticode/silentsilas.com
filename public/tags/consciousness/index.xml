      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with neuroscience as of late. What follows are just a few points I found remarkable in my reading of Altered States of Consciousness - Experiences Out of Time and Self by Marc Wittmann.
In a life or death situation, it&amp;rsquo;s quite blurry whether people truly experience time in slow motion, or if they only remember their emotionally-charged event that way. It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult phenomenon to replicate in a laboratory setting for obvious reasons.</description>

      <description>I sort of spaced out Into an ethereal dreamWhile she fell back Into her usual routineOf noticing Amidst the materialThat Which my eyes have never seen.She ponders for a bit in confusionThe possible reasons for my doubt,But it&#39;s the subject of possibilityThe inexplicable mind can&#39;t figure outAs I soar above the tops of buildingsAnd dive into the Atlantic oceanWith uncanny buoyancy I believedAs just another preconceived notionUntil I cast that factInto the back Of the recycle binAfter I break The REM cycleAnd consciousness clocks back in.</description>
