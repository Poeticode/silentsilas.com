      <description>In a moment Of relapse,A desire For love Arose.I gave my heartstrings To a girlTo knit a warmerSet of clothes.I was hoping For a sweater,But instead, Received her mask.She thanked me kindlyFor the coatAnd I knewI shouldn&#39;t ask.Was itSeasonal depressionThat left me seekingOut a sun?A candleCan&#39;t replace it,But any fireIs better than none.</description>

      <description>I thought my heart was broken,Or its voice far too soft-spokenUntil I walked past by a grave.It was normally unkempt and bare,But today a rose sings it a prayer:A somber song their lover gave. </description>
