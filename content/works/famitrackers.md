title: Fooling With Famitracker
year: 2018

Here are two tracks I made in FamiTracker that I'm actually a bit proud of! They were probably written back in 2011.

{{< audio filepath="/famitracker/3.wav" fileext="wav" >}}

You can check out the raw .ftm file <a href="/famitracker/3.ftm">here</a>, which you would open in Famitracker to see all of the notes laid out.

{{< audio filepath="/famitracker/4.wav" fileext="wav" >}}

Same as above, you can check out the .ftm file <a href="/famitracker/4.ftm">here</a>.
