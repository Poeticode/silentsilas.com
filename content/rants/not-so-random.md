title: Lol, Aren't I So Random?

On the surface, randomness seems pretty straight-forward. But it gets messy pretty quick once you try to pin down what it actually _is_. But before we dive down that <a href="#philosophy">philosophical rabbit hole</a>, let us first ask what it is that you actually _want_ from your _randomness_.

### A Bit Too Random
Let's say you're a teacher and you have an educational app that "randomly" chooses one of five scenarios to play through whenever a student begins the experience. However, it's not long before you hear a student complain that the app isn't random at all! After playing through it several times, she has only encountered one of the five scenarios. What gives?



It's very likely that the app is _too random_, and you instead are in need of an _evenly-distributed quasi-randomness_.

### A Completely Random Idea
True randomness can be derived from an indeterministic system, but we've yet to prove whether such a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism">system can exist</a>. Heisenburg's <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/uncertainty-principle/media/614029/216617">Uncertainty Principle</a> is probably our best argument for indeterminism. It states that, at the subatomic level, "the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa."<a href="#ref0">[0]</a> Therefore it's impossible for us to know the state of every particle in the universe and "predict" the future. We could perhaps figure out a pretty likely future, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a> throws a wrench in that plan. The implications of the Uncertainty Principle <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/God_does_not_play_dice_with_the_universe">freaked Einstein out</a>. He insisted that quantum mechanics is simply missing a local<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> hidden variable, and upon knowing that variable, we can then accurately predict quantum interactions. But it wasn't long before we hit another <a href="/imgs/epr_paradox.PNG">roadblock</a> with <a href="/imgs/bells_theorem.PNG">Bell's Theorem</a>, whereby no theory with local hidden variables can reproduce quantum mechanic's predictions. There's either something that can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon">travel faster than the speed of light</a> to influence these particles, or the underlying laws of the universe are truly indeterministic.

<span id="ref1">[1]</span> Local, in this context, means it can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings. Nonlocality scares Einstein, because it means that _something_ can travel faster than the speed of light, breaking the theory of relativity. For more info, look up "Spooky Action At A Distance".
