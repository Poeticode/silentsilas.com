title: Leafscaping

---
Hours of raking and blowing of leaves  
Only to have twice more fall from the trees  
By the friendly frolic of an Autumn breeze.

Yet there in the distance an object appears  
By the result of your blood, sweat, and tears;  
It's the manifestation of your misplaced fears!

As you creep ever closer to the object in sight,  
It's not long before you're filled with delight  
As your landlocked body begins to take flight  
To crash into a leaf pile of impressive height.
