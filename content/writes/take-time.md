{{< poem >}}
The perma-pedestrian 
Watched in awe 
Of the passing cars.

Each driver longs
To extend their life
With Audis & Jaguars.

Each piston obeys
Thermodynamic law
Exploding every decisecond.

The law of inertia
Transfers heat to our heads
Upon braking at the intersection.

The human VROOMS.
Huffs and FUMES.
Shortcircuits- KaBOOMS!

The cycle repeats
Until there remains
No more lives to lose.
