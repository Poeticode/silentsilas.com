{{< poem >}}
"Caffee,
Getcha some coffee!"
My pops called
To my mum.

Names are chopped 
And trim'd
Then morph again
Into something new.

The same thing goes
For those of whom
You thought you knew.

You can call me Silas now.
Joseph sounds just so antique.

The "Cup of Joe"
Is getting cold;
It's time to try
Something unique.

Who would I be
If I kept that drink?
